#### :technologist: I recently completed my internship at Viewnext Company (IBM), where I focused on Android mobile development using modern technologies and clean architecture (MVVM).
#### During this experience, I developed an Android application using Kotlin with Jetpack Compose for the user interface. My responsibilities included database design and implementation, dependency injection architecture, API consumption for external service integration, version control management through GitHub, and ensuring code quality through unit testing with JUnit.
#### This internship provided me with hands-on experience in modern Android development and allowed me to apply theoretical knowledge in a professional environment.

:nerd_face: Always `learning new things`.

:thinking: Iâ€™m currently open for a new `job opportunity`, this is [MY LinkeIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/romina-rita-luppi-9053804a/).
